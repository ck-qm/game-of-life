 * Test class for Game of Life
 * 
 * Start here with Test-Driven Development:
 * 1. Write a failing test
 * 2. Write just enough code to make it pass
 * 3. Refactor
 * 
 * Example test cases to consider:
 * - A live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies
 * - A live cell with two or three neighbors lives
 * - A live cell with more than three neighbors dies
 * - A dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes alive
